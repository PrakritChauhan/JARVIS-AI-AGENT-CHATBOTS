This is c chatbot that was created for a hypothetical business scenario and implements RAG to extract information from its database to answer user questions about business. By implementing RAG, it
ensures that only the required and necessary information about the question is extracted and used. Rather than giving all company info in the prompt, the RAG strategy allows the llm to determine what information
is useful to answer the user question.
